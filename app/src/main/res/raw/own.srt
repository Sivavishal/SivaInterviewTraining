00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:5,074
Subtitle Task...

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,080
There you go.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:09,960
Thanks, Billy.

4
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,840
Derry's not like any town I've ever been in before.

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,320
People die or disappear six times the national average.

6
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,560
And that's just grown-ups.

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,900
Kids are worse.

8
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,580
Way, way worse.

9
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,180
We float down here.

10
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,180
I saw something.

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,460
There was this...

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,180
A clown.

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Yeah, I saw him too.

14
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:24,760
Look.

15
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,180
It's all connected by the sewers.

16
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,660
It's where It lives.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,500
What happened?

18
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,180
Turn it off!

19
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:05,920
Bill.

20
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,660
If you'll come with me, you'll float too.

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,860
George...

22
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,100
You'll float too.

23
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,020
You'll float too.

24
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,440
You'll float too.
